# scoping-app

## Commands

Activate virtual env
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run server
```
python3 -m http.server
```

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Initial structure before `main.py` and `main.js` are executed
- `main.py`: Where Brython logic is written. Connects the frontend to the scoping code. Reinitializes DOM elements after `index.html` is parsed. Ultimately saves the stringified JSON containing graph data from the scoping code to localStorage, which `main.js` then reads. More docs in in-file comments.
- `main.js`: Reads graph data from localStorage (generated by `main.py`). Builds D3 graph (e.g. nodes, links, labels) using said graph data. Handles any dynamic behavior of the graph (e.g. node onClick to display its details). More docs in in-file comments.
- `demo.html`: Not key to this project, but if you navigate to `/demo` after running the server, you'll get a page of useful Brython docs and examples
